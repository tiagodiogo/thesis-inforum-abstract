The work on the proposed solution is guided by the following schedule:

\begin{itemize}
	\item January 9\textsuperscript{th} 2016 - January 31\textsuperscript{st}: Search for the most suitable protocol and operating system implementations for constrained devices.
	\item February 1\textsuperscript{st} 2016 - February 15\textsuperscript{th}: Implement, Test and Debug the proposed solution on a Network Simulator (first version).
	\item February 16\textsuperscript{st} 2016 - February 29\textsuperscript{th}: Implement, Test and Debug the proposed solution on a Network Simulator (improved version)
	\item March 1\textsuperscript{st} - March 15\textsuperscript{th}: Implement, Test and Debug on a Physically Constructed Network (first version).
	\item March 16\textsuperscript{th} - March 31\textsuperscript{th}: Implement, Test and Debug on a Physically Constructed Network (improved version).
	\item April 1\textsuperscript{st} - April 11\textsuperscript{th}: Measure, profile and document energy consumptions for the previously described test cases.
	\item April 12\textsuperscript{th} - May 12\textsuperscript{th}: MSc Thesis Writing
	\item May 13\textsuperscript{th}: MSc Thesis Delivery
