In this document we start by analysing the state of the art in Section \ref{sec:related_work}. This includes the selection of the most adequate protocol stack for our necessities in Section \ref{sec:protocol_analysis}, an overview of the existing attacks and mitigation strategies in Section \ref{sec:attack_analysis} and a summary of the existing solutions regarding secure insertion of new nodes in an existing network in Section \ref{sec:secure_bootstrapping}. All this knowledge will be integrated into our proposed solution defined in Section \ref{sec:proposed_solution}. Section \ref{sec:work_evaluation} defines how our work will be tested and evaluated so that a power-aware perspective can be achieved. Section \ref{sec:work_planning} states how the development of our solution will unwind over the next months and finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusion} presents the conclusion of the document.
