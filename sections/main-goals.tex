\paragraph{}
Given the constraints and limitations of \ac{IoT} devices described in the previous chapter and the recent protocols, the first objective of this work is to identify a working stack of protocols that takes into account these constraints and focuses on allowing a power-aware communication model.

\paragraph{}
After the analysis of the existing solutions, a baseline of power consumption will be established. Then, the focus will move towards adding confidentiality to the transmitted information by securing the channel.
Once both the application level protocols and proper security solutions are defined, experiments will be performed so that the added power consumption cost of adding the security layers can be measured, profiled and documented therefore enabling the finding of the best parameters for a desired level of security.

\paragraph{}
The work will then proceed towards finding effective counter-measures against a specific group of attacks that targets the \ac{IoT} devices by intensifying the use of its resources, therefore draining the available power and placing the device offline. The ultimate goal is to propose an energy-efficient administration system that can provide the tools to resist those attacks and assure a proper working network.
